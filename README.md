# invaders - detect space invaders

Plan:

1. Parse space invaders and radar samples.
2. Create tests.
3. Create a simple linear filter to locate invaders.

We will use clojure data structures for linear algebra here - we are supposed to showcase ours skills 
and not optimise performance.

# How to run?

lein run "resources/simple-1.txt" 0.75

for swiping the simple-1 radar input with threshold probability 0.75

It has been experimentally determined that 0.75 threshold works well for sample-1.
